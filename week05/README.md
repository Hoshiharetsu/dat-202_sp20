## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

First thing tonight: we're walking down to Advising to get your graduation paperwork done. 

Next thing: On March 5th at 4pm, the DAT faculty are convening to start the process of rebuilding our curriculum. Some things will stay the same (e.g. I don't imagine DAT-102 will be entirely reimagined from scratch, but some of the higher-level courses will need major facelifts). Students are invited to show up then; for those folks who aren't available then, you're also welcome to give us comments that we should take into account when we're doing the redesign.

## <span id="readings">Homework/Readings</span>

* First, let's chat about the Kaggle presentations we went to last week. Anything we observed about how the teams worked, about how the projects were done? 
* Next, let's chat about anonymization and confidentiality.
