## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

[Updated attendance policy](../attendance_policy.md) (draft until all of my in-person students have had a chance to comment) 

It's SOSO week. You all know the drill; SOSOs are different from [my informal survey](https://forms.gle/PfkyG9iXN1VBLsqYA).

## <span id="readings">Homework/Readings</span>

* We gave ourselves two weeks to pull together data for a possible final project for this course. It's time to talk through what we've found! Can we do a project based on this, or had we better find something else?

## <span id="github">GitHub</span>

I'm writing up the lesson in [its own markdown file](github.md).

We're going to work in [this repo](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/datasets), later today.

### Homework

Find datasets people have used, or example project outputs that are really good (map layouts, cool visualizations, even very nice spreadsheets), anonymize them if possible, and add them to an appropriate place in the datasets repository on the ccac-data-analytics GitHub. I'll accept pull requests. (Remember to `git pull` often, in case someone else is updating the same file or folder you want to update.)
