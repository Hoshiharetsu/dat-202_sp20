It's SOSO week. You all know the drill; SOSOs are different from [my informal survey](https://forms.gle/PfkyG9iXN1VBLsqYA).

## <span id="readings">Homework/Readings</span>

* We gave ourselves two weeks to pull together data for a possible final project for this course. It's time to talk through what we've found! 

## <span id="github">GitHub</span>

Branching.
Remotes.
Git-flow as a workflow.

We're going to work in [this repo](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/datasets)
