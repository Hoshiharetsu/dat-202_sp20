## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

Wow, things sure are a lot, aren't they? If you need help during the next few weeks, or you're looking for how to help others, [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oL6ju8kEQd_cWltkufZvVq1tMGetsY92ZVDzlwPa35I/edit?usp=sharing) is full of resources.

Do we need to talk about CCAC's, Pittsburgh's, Allegheny County's, or Pennsylvania's current timeline, before we talk about this class specifically?

Are we all OK with talking about COVID-19 statistics and forecasts in class? I've received some "yes" answers via the survey and email, but _anyone can say no at any time_ and we will not talk about it. (If it gets to a point where _I_ have to say "no," I also will.) 

## <span id="readings">Homework/Readings</span>

We'll share data sets that you've found for inclusion in our CCAC Data Analytics "datasets" repository in a bit. 

## <span id="guest">Tonight's Guest Speaker!</span>

My friend and colleague [Abigail Goben](https://hedgehoglibrarian.com/about/) is joining us on Zoom to talk about the following:
* analytics in higher education
* the Data Doubles project and what we're learning so far from the students
* data management planning (it's not just for research anymore!)

As a reminder, you had questions to think about before class:
1) What kind of information is your institution tracking about its students? 
2) Are there potential benefits to this tracking? 
3) Are there potential harms? 
4) When you've worked collaboratively on a project for school or for your job -- have you had a time where you couldn't find necessary files? What happened?

## <span id="github">GitHub</span>

I'm writing up the lesson in [its own markdown file](github.md).

We're going to work in [this repo](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/datasets), if we have time and energy later today.

### Homework

Think about 1) what this class _could/should be_ and 2) what it _can realistically be,_ given our circumstances (online-only for the rest of the semester, quite possibly without the support of a physical campus and its accompanying resources). Think about your own resources, too&mdash;your computer and network connectivity, how much your job is taking you away from your studies if you're currently trying to work remotely, any caregiving you may have to do for family (or for yourself!)&mdash;and, although I won't ask you to share any of the details with me, that should certainly impact your answer. 

Join me on [Slack](https://ccac-data-analytics.slack.com) during the week (we have a #dat-202 channel) to have a conversation about what we want to do, going forward. If you all want a private channel, so that nobody else can peek in, I'm happy to make one for us.

If you need help with Slack, I've posted some links in Blackboard.
