## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

Wow, things sure are a lot, aren't they? 

## <span id="readings">Homework/Readings</span>

We'll share data sets that you've found for inclusion in our CCAC Data Analytics "datasets" repository in a bit. 

## <span id="guest">Tonight's Guest Speaker!</span>

My friend and colleague [Abigail Goben](https://hedgehoglibrarian.com/about/) is joining us on Zoom to talk about the following:
* analytics in higher education
* the Data Doubles project and what we're learning so far from the students
* data management planning (it's not just for research anymore!)

## <span id="github">GitHub</span>

I'm writing up the lesson in [its own markdown file](github.md). (Not updated yet!)

We're going to work in [this repo](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/datasets), later today.

### Homework

Think about 1) what this class _could/should be_ and 2) what it _can realistically be,_ given our circumstances (online-only for the rest of the semester, quite possibly without the support of a physical campus and its accompanying resources). Think about your own resources, too&mdash;your computer and network connectivity, how much your job is taking you away from your studies if you're currently trying to work remotely, any caregiving you may have to do for family (or for yourself!)&mdash;and, although I won't ask you to share any of the details with me, that should certainly impact your answer. 

Join me on [Slack](https://ccac-data-analytics.slack.com) during the week (we have a #dat-202 channel) to have a conversation about what we want to do, going forward. 

If you need help with Slack, I've posted some links in Blackboard.
