## <span id="announcements"> 0. Announcements</span>

Reminder that **next week we're meeting at Carlow for [this](https://www.meetup.com/PGH-Data-Science/events/267877749/). Does anyone need to carpool? (Just as an FYI: I invited the 201s, too. And I did mention the existence of this to Eric, as well.)

I know this is a very small class, and I hope you all to feel confident and empowered that it is _your_ class as much at is mine. If you have suggestions, I hope you know it's fine to voice them in class or one-on-one with me. ... But I also remember what it's like to have anxiety about talking with professors, so I made [a short survey](https://forms.gle/PfkyG9iXN1VBLsqYA) that you can fill out at any time during the semester if you have comments you want to share with me anonymously. I've also linked it on the README under [files](../files). I'll leave it up all semester. 

The DAT/MMC/CIT faculty have put in our requests for courses for next semester: 102, 119, 129, 201, 202, 203, and that's it -- but do we need to talk about it? (next spring: yes to 204 and 281, no to 202 and 203)

Let's discuss.

## <span id="stats"> 2. Statistics review</span>

Aaron has graciously volunteered to do a stats review with us. (Thank you, Aaron!) I'm bringing along a stats book, in case there are lingering questions that Aaron or I can't answer off the top of one of our heads. 

In case anyone misses class tonight, or needs a second (or third or fourth) time through any of it, I've gathered a whole bunch of LinkedIn Learning videos (entire courses, actually) that should be helpful: [sign in with your CCAC credentials to see them](https://www.linkedin.com/checkpoint/enterprise/login/42461012?pathWildcard=42461012&application=learning&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Flearning%2Fpaths%2Fcommunity-college-of-allegheny-county-stats-for-data-analytics%3Fu%3D42461012) ... It's 17 hours' worth of content. I do not, in any way, shape, or form, expect you to go through all of it. But it is there for you to look at and might help you prepare your student-teaching section, too. 

[This is a pretty good stats cheatsheet, too](http://web.mit.edu/~csvoss/Public/usabo/stats_handout.pdf)

## <span id="stats"> 3. Homework</span>

We are meeting off-campus next week. Bring questions about how the teams did their work. (Or about any aspect of this that you want to know about, but we're attending primarily to learn about data analysis by teams, right?)

These readings about anonymization/de-anonymization are all due in two weeks, and you can split them up between this week and next in any way you like:
* [Robust De-anonymization of Large Datasets(How to Break Anonymity of the Netflix Prize Dataset)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610105.pdf)
* [Protecting the confidentiality of America's Statistics: Adopting Modern Disclosure Avoidance Methods at the Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/research-matters/2018/08/protecting_the_confi.html)
* [Privacy and security  Myths and fallacies of “Personally identifiable information”](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_cacm10.pdf)
