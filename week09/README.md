## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

Let's check in, see how we're all doing.  

This question remains open for the rest of the semester: Are we all OK with talking about COVID-19 statistics and forecasts in class? I've received some "yes" answers via the survey and email, but _anyone can say no at any time_ and we will not talk about it. (If it gets to a point where _I_ have to say "no," I also will.) 

## <span id="readings">Homework/Readings</span>

Continue conversation from Slack?

We'll share data sets that you've found for inclusion in our CCAC Data Analytics "datasets" repository (and I have alternate ideas for anyone who doesn't have data sets to share). 

## <span id="github">GitHub</span>

I'm writing up the lesson in [its own markdown file](github.md).

We're going to work in [this repo](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/datasets), if we have time and energy today.

### Homework

We'll figure out what it should be in class, yeah? And we'll keep it light.
