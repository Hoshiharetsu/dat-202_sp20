## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

Let's check in, see how we're all doing.

## <span id="work">Work</span>

We decided to work collaboratively on a report about data analytics and COVID-19. (Reminder: if you can't bring yourself to work on this, just let me know, and we'll talk about what a good alternate plan is.) So, we'll use the next few weeks' sessions to check in on how it's going, talk about progress, etc.

Here's where we're doing the work:
* Our GitHub: https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/covid_19_project
* Our Drive: [ugly link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NKMgWpdmpNneb-WJYa08tRK_JXfJ7qUg?usp=sharing) - you need to be logged into the Google account you sent me to see this


## <span id="github">GitHub Lesson</span>

I wrote up and recorded informal videos about the whole GitHub workflow and put them on the Data Analytics GitHub account: https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/learn_github

If you want to work through it all, great! Please do! But also please stop and email me when you get to the part that says to do so, and I'll let you know when to take your turn making a pull request. The 201s will be taking turns over the next week or two, as well. (This is not how it would be done on a real project&mdash;you would each probably have one or more branches you were working on, in different areas of the code base&mdash;but doing them one-by-one decreases the chances of a merge conflict, since most of what people are doing is editing one of 3-4 README files.)

If you want other things added to the lessons that are up there, let me know! (I guess "dealing with a merge conflict" is one possibility.)

## <span id="online_confs">An ever-growing list of online-conferences we might like</span>

* [PyCon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjMBMGt0WJQLeluw6qNJuA) - Would have been in Pittsburgh this year. Later this week, actually. Many of the planned talks will end up on the YouTube channel (which is what I linked, above, instead of [the conference website](https://us.pycon.org/2020/). Also, I'm (virtually) attending the Education Summit and the Trainers' Summit on the 23rd and 24th.
* [CSVconf](https://csvconf.com/) - May 13-14 online.
